Introduction

  Welcome to the project site of the eID Middleware for Android Project.

  The eID Middleware for Android is available in the {{{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.e_contract.eid.android}Google Play app store}}.

  The eID Middleware for Android should work with any USB CCID smart card reader.
  
  The eID Middleware for Android offers two components:

  * The eID Middleware for Android application itself. This application contains:
    
    * The eID Middleware Android service

    * The eID Viewer (using the service)

    []

  * The eID Middleware for Android library

  Via this library you can connect to the service.

  Check out the {{{./eid-mw-android-lib}eID Middleware for Android Library}} for more information.

* Architecture

  The entry point of the eID Middleware for Android is the <<<BeIDService>>> Android Service.
  Via AIDL other processes can bind to this service.
  The <<<BeIDService>>> is using the low-level USB host mode to query for USB CCID smart card readers.
  It is also using a <<<BroadcastReceiver>>> for the detection of USB device detachments.
  Once a smart card reader is detected we request for USB permissions and finally end up starting the core <<<CCID>>>.

  The <<<CCID>>> Runnable is doing a simple loop where it detects an inserted eID card, performs some operations on it, and then detects the card removal.
  When the USB interrupt endpoint is available, we use it to avoid the need for constant USB interface polling.
  The actual implemention is straightforward CCID, and on top ISO 7816-4 APDU handling.

  The architecture is offering an asynchronous interface towards the service consumers.
  This gives us a very intuitive experience towards integrating developers, and makes sure that we never 'hang' in the Activities.

  Although the offered API is far from functional complete, the eID Middleware for Android foundations are solid enough to last for a while.
